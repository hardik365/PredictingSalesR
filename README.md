# PredictingSalesR
In this project, I try to find a way to accurately predict the sales of a few products for a fictional company. 
Additionally, we analyzed to see if reviews have any sort of impact on the amount of products sold.
This project was built on R and we used the package titled "Caret" to build a few machine-learning models and picked the one that worked best for our case.
